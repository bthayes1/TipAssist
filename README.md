## **Extra Information**
I decided to make this app in a response to a Android Development college course I followed on YouTube. I am attempting to become more proficient at Android and Tip Assist is one of my first steps. This was a good learning tool to understand how to develop the UI, while also learning a lot about Kotlin.
